                    Hackathon is an event conducted with the idea to bring people from different

walks of life, possessing different sets of skills, to work together and solve some

real-world problems using their attained skills. The most important part of any

hackathon is team building and utilization of the resources available may it be in

the form of knowledge, expertise, or material.

Hackathon will make the teams work at their full potential. Hackathon provides an

environment where all teams work under time and resource constraints. This helps

bring out the best results.

    <td><strong>PS7</strong> </td>

    <td>Background: The world’s

      natural resources are already depleting, and people

      are starting to feel the repercussions of a wasteful lifestyle. As such, energy conservation is vital in

      today’s world. Not only does it help

      households save money, but it also encourages

      consumers to be more conscious about

      preserving natural resources.

      IoT has made homes smarter, so its application in

      energy conservation is more accessible. Smart

      appliances can inform homeowners of real-time

      consumption so that

      they can monitor their energy usage. Reports can

      easily be generated or extracted, allowing

      homeowners to

      monitor their daily, weekly, and monthly energy

      consumption

      accurately.

      <br> In addition, sensors can be installed so

      that when owners leave the house, appliances will

      automatically turn off to conserve energy.

      Summary: In order to conserve the energy, we need

      to keep a check on all the type of resources that are

      being used

      in our day-to-day life. With IoT it becomes easy to

      track the resources we are using and we can monitor

      and keep a check

      on. Reports generated from such monitoring system

      can help in conserving natural

      resources and reduce

      unnecessary wastage if any.

      Objective: We would like you to develop a

      mobile/web app system using IoT to make

      energy conservation easy. Also provide reports on

      usage of all the resources in day-to-day life

      and smart automation methods to reduce the

      amounts of any

      resource we use.</td>

    <td><strong>PS8</strong> </td>

    <td>Background: In order to realise the goal of

      demographic divide, every citizen of the country needs to be educated for job, be it a scientist, a

      doctor, engineer or whatever to meet not only the

      needs of our society but also the other societies

      elsewhere in the world. Every student aspires to

      become a great person and self reliant, but their

      passion and likings are diverse. In order to cater to

      the aspirations of the students and facilitate them

      to aim it high, they are required to be informed about

      the number and type of jobs this country has in the

      future years, as also the number of business

      persons, entrepreneurs, workforce in all areas of

      employment. A national database of actual

      requirement of workforce, category-wise by both

      Government and Industry, the type of educational or

      skill qualification required, nature of job, eligibility

      criteria, salary and perks, career development

      /progression in every field / sector of employment is

      urgently required. As each individual nurtures

      different desires to become in their life, there is a

      need for career dendrogram, so that one can

      put forth a concerted efforts to become the best in

      his vocation and excel in life rather than make

      umpteen number of mistakes of wrong selection of

      course of education or career and repent later and go

      on trying different things losing his precious

      time/life. Summary: A national database of actual

      Objective: We need you to develop a portal where

      we can use the national database to track the

      development of individuals. According to their

      performance in their workplace, their hobbies and

      extracurricular activities the portal should suggest

      them their career goals. This can be what they are

      best in and according to that what is the best career

      they can choose for themselves. This can reduce in

      making mistakes in selecting career.</td>
